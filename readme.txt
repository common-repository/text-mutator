== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create redacted text? =

There are a few ways, depending on your case. The easiest way is to change the color of the background to the same color of the text, creating a block of color. Another way is to use the black marker background behind black text. Using either of these methods with the Text Jumble option will produce an unreadable segment of text.

= How do I create highlighted text? =

Use the background image for Yellow Highlighter and change the text color to whatever you’d like except yellow.
